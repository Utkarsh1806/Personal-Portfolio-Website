# Personal-Portfolio-Website
A personal portfolio website is a website that showcases an individual's skills, experience, and achievements. HTML and CSS are two essential tools that are used to build this type of website. HTML is responsible for creating the structure of the website, including headings, paragraphs, lists, and links, while CSS adds style and design to the website, including colors, fonts, and layouts. A personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS typically consists of several pages that display the individual's bio, work experience, education, projects, and contact information. The website can also include a gallery of images, testimonials, and a blog section to showcase the individual's expertise and interests. Overall, a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS is a great way to showcase an individual's work and skills to potential employers, clients, or collaborators.
